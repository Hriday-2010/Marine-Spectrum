1. Project summary
 
Ocean acoustics is becoming a blooming field of research in the recent times for its wide spread scope of acoustics in studying the acoustical behavior in underwater. With the applicability of sound as a primary source of communication in underwater, the range of applications that it offers have grown drastically in exploratory and conservatory applications. The high intervention of anthropogenic activities in the oceans has largely impacted the natural functioning of the bio acoustic sources in the ocean demanding the need ocean life conservatory approaches. On a general note designing a non-invasive marine life monitoring application imposes concerns like the limited bandwidth for communication, high propagation, resource and power availability related challenges that are emphasized problems, whereas the challenge of improper ocean acoustic spectrum utilization that imposes major threat to the aquatic life is less addressed. The artificial acoustic systems being a mimicked version of the natural acoustic systems is generally designed as a single network neglecting the existence of biological sources in the ocean. The prevalence of both the acoustic sources over crowds the ocean acoustic spectrum resulting in a high interfering ocean acoustic spectrum. Despite the heavily shared frequency bands the ocean is still both temporarily and spatially underutilized leading to an inefficiently utilized ocean spectrum. As an effort to calm down these effects, we have proposed an end to end marine habitat friendly efficient ocean acoustic spectrum utilization framework that is aimed to effective utilize the scare acoustic spectrum without any over or underutilization majorly addressing the issue of mid frequency bands clashing.

2. Objectives of the project
 
This project is aimed to implement the proposed effective ocean acoustic spectrum management framework phase by phase from spectrum sensing followed by spectrum decision and spectrum sharing addressing the challenge of improper spectrum utilization especially in the mid frequencies. The framework would work as an efficient spectrum decision approach that senses and effectively distributes the frequency bands to the acoustic sources mainly prioritizing the bioacoustic sources in the ocean. We have aimed to implement the framework as a time delayed model. The project is aimed to be implemented using real time raw passive acoustic soundscape recordings of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) with the bottlenose dolphin as the species of interest. 

3. Expected output and outcome of the proposal
 
The outcome of the proposed project will be a phase wise implementation of the proposed ocean spectrum utilization framework from spectrum sensing to spectrum sharing designed to offer a complete end-to-end approach. The acoustic composition of the sources as bio phony, geophony and anthrophony will be assessed in the raw ocean passive acoustic data followed by which the biological and the non- biological sources will be separated with acoustic feature of peaks to distinguish the biological and the non-biological sources. The automated species call detection system designed will aid in precisely identifying the individual bio acoustic sources in the source separated data. The individually detected sources will be classified to the specific species category to allocate acoustic frequencies precisely. The range of the mobilizing source will be familiarized in the sound source localization to perform selective spectrum utilization to the prioritized species. From the source information, the acoustic sources will be allocated with the operating mid frequency bands without any frequency clashes. All the acoustic sources are considered in the spectrum utilization and not just limiting it to marine mammals. With the increasing human demands on the ocean and its resources, the intrusion of anthropogenic activities in the ocean is ever-growing. Hence, the need for an efficient spectrum utilization approach is inevitable.

### **1. Project Summary**  
Ocean acoustics is a rapidly growing field due to its critical role in underwater communication, exploration, and conservation. The increasing anthropogenic activities in marine environments have disrupted natural bioacoustic systems, necessitating non-invasive monitoring solutions. Current underwater acoustic systems face challenges such as limited bandwidth, high propagation losses, and power constraints, but a less addressed issue is the inefficient utilization of the ocean acoustic spectrum.  

The artificial and biological acoustic sources in the ocean often share crowded frequency bands, leading to interference, while other bands remain underutilized. To address this, we propose an **end-to-end marine habitat-friendly spectrum utilization framework** that optimizes the allocation of acoustic frequencies, particularly mitigating clashes in the mid-frequency range. By integrating spectrum sensing, decision-making, and sharing mechanisms, this framework ensures efficient spectrum use while prioritizing bioacoustic sources.
